# demo

# howto

You need `websocket-client` python package:

    $ sudo pip install websocket-client

You also need `ensime_launcher` package:

    $ sudo pip install ensime_launcher

You should also export your BROWSER variable, for example in your bashrc:

    export BROWSER=firefox

All the following commands should be run from your scala directory.

First you need ensime sbt plugin:    
    
    $ echo addSbtPlugin("org.ensime" % "ensime-sbt" % "0.1.7") \
        >> ~/.sbt/0.13/plugins/plugins.sbt

Then, generate .ensime file:

    $ sbt gen-ensime

Then install vim plugin, with [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim),
by adding to your .vimrc:

    Plugin 'ensime/ensime-vim'

Or if you're using neovim, with [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
by installing neovim python module:

    $ pip install neovim

and by adding to your .nvimrc:

    Plug 'ensime/ensime-vim'

Then by doing a :PlugInstall and a :UpdateRemotePlugins under neovim

Finally, launch vim with the file(s) you want to edit:

    $ vim src/scaloid/example/HelloScaloid.scala

# event handling

Under neovim, for all commands except autocomplete, events are only handled when you move your cursor (CursorMoved event).
Under vim, we use [CursorHold](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Timer_to_execute_commands_periodically) event.

# using ensime-vim

[User documentation](doc/ensime-vim) is available, you can also load it inside vim via:

    :help ensime-vim

# developer howto

vim plugin is generated from neovim plugin.
You should install neo2vim ruby gem:

    $ gem install neo2vim

Then you should do your modifications to:

    rplugin/python/ensime.py 
    
And export them to vim plugin format via:

    $ neo2vim rplugin/python/ensime.py ftplugin/scala_ensime.vim

Needs some love. Please get in contact if you would like to help! There was some old work that is no longer compatible with the ENSIME server but it may serve as a good starting place:
